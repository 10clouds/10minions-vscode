# 10Minions by 10Clouds: GPT-4 Powered Coding Assistant

Unleash your fleet of digital minions with 10Minions by 10Clouds. Backed by the power of GPT-4, each minion acts as an autonomous agent within your codebase. Task them with complex coding assignments, then watch as they work simultaneously, ensuring your code is clean, efficient, and adheres to industry standards. Experience the simplicity and effectiveness of multitasking with 10Minions.

## Key Features

With 10Minions, you have the ability to:

- Translate complex coding tasks into natural language directives.
- Streamline your coding process across a multitude of files.
- Leverage the collaborative capabilities of minions for optimum solutions.
- Save time and mental bandwidth as minions handle multiple operations simultaneously.
- Employ minions across various programming languages.

10Minions by 10Clouds, your diligent team of code optimizers, works tirelessly behind the scenes, helping maintain a clean, efficient, and robust codebase. Explore the power of autonomous coding and boost your productivity with 10Minions today.

## How it Works

The plugin uses existing APIs to streamline your work in Visual Studio Code. Specify the changes you want developed in a file, hit 'Go', and let the AI handle the code for you. This process may take some time due to multiple GPT-4 calls. However, you can run this multiple times on various files concurrently, freeing you to focus on other tasks.

The plugin is compatible with any programming language and is expected to be released in mid-June.

## Use Cases

Here are a few practical scenarios where 10Minions can be utilized:

1. Editing ESLintrc to remove the line size limit without needing to remember the exact process or google it.
2. Extracting functionality to a new file, running the Code Cook to clean up and optimize the code.
3. Requesting the Code Cook to "Fix this hack" in a setTimeout function.
4. Logging type data of a returned object from an API by asking "Log type data of stream, it's methods etc".
5. Marking some of the component code and asking for fix: “Render messages somewhere around here”.

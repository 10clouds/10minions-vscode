I will add a new property called `contentWhenRemoved` to the MinionTask class and create a new method called `remove()` that will be called when the user removes the task. Inside this method, I'll set the `contentWhenRemoved` property to the current content and call the `stopExecution()` method to stop the task execution.

REPLACE
  contentWhenDismissed: string;
WITH
  contentWhenDismissed: string;
  contentWhenRemoved: string;
END_REPLACE

REPLACE
    contentWhenDismissed = "",
WITH
    contentWhenDismissed = "",
    contentWhenRemoved = "",
END_REPLACE

REPLACE
    this.contentWhenDismissed = contentWhenDismissed;
WITH
    this.contentWhenDismissed = contentWhenDismissed;
    this.contentWhenRemoved = contentWhenRemoved;
END_REPLACE

ADD
  public async remove() {
    // Store the content when the task is removed
    this.contentWhenRemoved = this.finalContent;

    // Stop the task execution
    await this.stopExecution(undefined, true);
  }
END_ADD

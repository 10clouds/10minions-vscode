First, I will describe my plan to implement the requested change. Then, I will provide the updated code with my modifications and comments.

Plan:
1. Update the `splitCommentIntoLines` function to preserve newlines from the original comment.
2. Modify the loop to detect and handle newline characters properly.

Now, I will elaborate on each step and provide the modified code snippet.

1. Update the `splitCommentIntoLines` function to preserve newlines from the original comment.
    - I will update the function to treat newline characters as word boundaries.
    - I will split the comment into words without removing newline characters.

2. Modify the loop to detect and handle newline characters properly. 
   - I will change the loop to check if the current word is a newline character.
   - If it's a newline character, I will push the current line to the lines array and start a new line.
   - Otherwise, I will perform the existing line length check to ensure the line doesn't exceed the maximum characters limit.

Modified code snippet:


// Modified the helper function:
function splitCommentIntoLines(comment: string, maxChars = 80): string[] {
  // Updated the regular expression to treat newline characters as word boundaries
  const words = comment.split(/(\s+|\n)/);
  const lines: string[] = [];
  let currentLine = words[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
    const word = words[i];
    // Check if the current word is a newline character
    if (word === '\n') {
      // If it's a newline character, push the current line and start a new line
      lines.push(currentLine);
      currentLine = '';
    } else if (currentLine.length + word.length + 1 <= maxChars) {
      currentLine += " " + word;
    } else {
      lines.push(currentLine);
      currentLine = word;
    }
  }

  if (currentLine.length > 0) {
    lines.push(currentLine);
  }

  return lines;
}

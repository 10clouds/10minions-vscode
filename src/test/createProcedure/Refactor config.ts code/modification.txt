1. Plan:
   a. Create an interface for stages.
   b. Change the Stage objects into instances of a new Stage class implementing the interface.
   c. Move the STAGES array and TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant into a separate module.
      
2. Elaborate:
   a. Create an interface for stages:
      - Define an interface named IStage with properties name (string), weight (number), and execution (function).
   b. Change the Stage objects into instances of a new Stage class implementing the interface:
      - Define a Stage class that implements the IStage interface.
      - Replace the plain objects in the STAGES array with instances of the Stage class.
   c. Move the STAGES array and TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant into a separate module:
      - Create a new file named stageConstants.ts.
      - Move the STAGES array and the TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant into stageConstants.ts.
      - Export the STAGES array and the TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant from stageConstants.ts.
      - Update the import statements in the current file to import the STAGES array and the TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant from stageConstants.ts.

Here is the refactored code:

---- Start code modification ----

===== Existing code: ====
export const STAGES = [
  ...
];

export const TOTAL_WEIGHTS = STAGES.reduce((acc, stage) => {
  return acc + stage.weight;
}, 0);

===== Refactored changes (version 1): ====
// STEP 1: CREATE INTERFACE
interface IStage {
  name: string;
  weight: number;
  execution: Function;
}

// STEP 2: DEFINE STAGE CLASS
class Stage implements IStage {
  constructor(public name: string, public weight: number, public execution: Function) {}
}

// STEP 3A: MOVE ARRARY AND CONSTANT INTO SEPARATE FILE (stageConstants.ts)
// Moved STAGES array and TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant to stageConstants.ts

// STEP 3B: UPDATE IMPORTS
import { STAGES, TOTAL_WEIGHTS } from './stageConstants';

---- End code modification ----

I have created a new file named stageConstants.ts and added the STAGES array and the TOTAL_WEIGHTS constant. Here is how it looks like:

---- Start new file stageConstants.ts ----

import { stageStarting } from "./1_stageStarting";
import { stageClassifyTask } from "./2_stageClassifyTask";
import { stageCreateModification } from "./3_stageCreateModification";
import { stageCreateModificationProcedure } from "./4_stageCreateModificationProcedure";
import { stageFinishing } from "./7_stageFinishing";

import { Stage } from './[FILE_NAME_OF_Refactored_changes]';


export const STAGES: Stage[] = [
  new Stage("Starting ...", 10, stageStarting),
  new Stage("Understanding ...", 50, stageClassifyTask),
  new Stage("Conceptualising ...", 100, stageCreateModification),
  new Stage("Preparing Changes ...", 80, stageCreateModificationProcedure),
  new Stage("Finishing ...", 10, stageFinishing),
];

export const TOTAL_WEIGHTS = STAGES.reduce((acc, stage) => {
  return acc + stage.weight;
}, 0);

---- End new file stageConstants.ts ----

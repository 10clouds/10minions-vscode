Step 1
Identify the part of the code where the value needs to be changed.

Upon analysing the file, I can see that the requirement is to change the MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH constant value to 200 from 100. 

Now, Let's modify the code accordingly.

Step 2
Update the value of the constant.

Here's the modified code.

```typescript
// Constants
export const MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH = 200; // Increased the value to 200 as per requirement.
```

In this code snippet, I have modified the value of the constant MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH to 200 as per the requirement.

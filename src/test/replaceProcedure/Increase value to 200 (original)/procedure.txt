I will modify the original code by changing the value of the constant `MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH` to 200 as per the requested modification.

# REPLACE
export const MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH = 100; //TODO: Increase this value to 200
# WITH
export const MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH = 200; // Increased the value to 200 as per requirement.
# END_REPLACE

First, let's address the error:

"Property 'auth' does not exist on type 'typeof import("/Users/maciel/Documents/Projects/mediaengine/node_modules/firebase/app/dist/app/index")'. Line: 63 Column: 33."

The error is indicating that 'auth' is not recognized as a feature of Firebase in the context of our project. This is generally due to an incorrect or incomplete import statement for the Firebase library.

The problem here is that we're trying to import and use 'firebase/auth', but the importation is not done correctly.

This is our current importation:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
```

The error can be resolved with a named import of 'firebase/auth' from 'firebase/app'. Let's change it to:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth, GoogleAuthProvider } from "firebase/auth";
```
Also you need to change usage everywhere afterwards:

```javascript
const auth = getAuth();
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
```

Here is the fixed code regarding to your requirement:

```javascript
//... other imports ...
import { getAuth, GoogleAuthProvider } from "firebase/auth";

//... initialization and other code ...

const auth = getAuth();
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();

const signIn = async () => {
  try {
    await signInWithPopup(auth, provider);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
    if (user) {
      setUser(user);
    } else {
      setUser(null);
    }
  });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);

//... other code ...
```

Remember, when working with modular Firebase SDK v9 and above, you should use these functional-form imports and functions from specific feature packages (like 'firebase/auth', 'firebase/firestore', etc.), instead of calling methods on the firebase object. This enables better tree shaking and reduces the bundle size of your app. 

Be aware that you should also update all other parts of your code where you're using the old method-form firebase calls, and switch into using these functions with the firebase instance passed as the first argument.
